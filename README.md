# AI Orchestrator Dashboard

A local dashboard for monitoring AI orchestrator runs. It watches run artifacts (tasks, phase logs, worker logs) produced by the orchestrator on disk and surfaces them in a live UI — projects in a sidebar, per-run phases/tasks/agents in a detail view, with token usage, status, and recent log tails.

## Stack

- **Client:** React 19 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind 4, Base UI / shadcn components, React Router
- **Server:** Express 5 (TypeScript via `tsx`) — reads run data from the local filesystem and exposes it over a small JSON API
- **Config:** Projects persist to `.data/projects.json` inside the repo (gitignored)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js **>= 20** (use `nvm use v20`)
- An orchestrator run directory on disk to point the dashboard at

## Getting started

```bash
nvm use v20
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts both processes concurrently:

- Client (Vite) on <http://localhost:4000>
- API server on <http://localhost:4001>

Override the API port with `PORT=<n> npm run dev:server` if needed.

## Scripts

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Run client + server together |
| `npm run dev:client` | Vite dev server only |
| `npm run dev:server` | API server with file watching (`tsx watch`) |
| `npm run build` | Type-check and build the client |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
